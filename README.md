# the TL;DR monster...

...is a friendly creature who helps you remember how to use terminal commands!

tldr.monster is an online copy of [TL;DR Pages](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr) which is
designed for in-terminal use using `curl`. 

To use it, run `curl tldr.monster/cmd`, replacing `cmd` with the command you want info on.

For instance, if I want info about `tar`, I would run `curl tldr.monster/tar`.
